Task:
Clean up the Git repository by properly handling all uncommitted and modified files listed below.

Files in Scope:

{{files}}
Scope and Constraints:
- You MAY scan the entire repository to understand context, file types, and relationships.
- You may ONLY modify ".gitignore" and commit files explicitly listed.
- Do NOT modify, commit, or delete any other files.
- The following actions are strictly prohibited:
  - Deleting any files
  - Squashing commits
  - Modifying existing commit history

Execution Requirements:

1. Repository Review
   - Review the repository state and Git status.
   - Identify which files in Files in Scope are uncommitted or modified.

2. Handling Binary or Irrelevant Files
   - Independently determine which files in Files in Scope should NOT be tracked or committed (e.g., binary files or irrelevant artifacts).
   - Update ".gitignore" to ignore these files or corresponding patterns.
   - Do NOT commit the ignored files themselves.
   - Commit the ".gitignore" change in ONE standalone commit.

3. Handling Files to Be Committed
   - For all remaining files in Files in Scope that should be committed:
     - Group changes strictly by change purpose (the underlying reason for the change).
     - Split the work into multiple atomic commits.
     - Each commit may include multiple files, but MUST represent exactly one clear and coherent change purpose.
     - Do NOT mix unrelated change purposes within a single commit.

4. Commit Message Requirements
   - Every commit message MUST follow this structure:
     "<type>[iter-{{iteration}}][atmp-{{attempt}}]: <short description>"
   - "<type>" must be semantically appropriate (e.g., fix, feat, docs, chore, refactor).
   - The description must be concise and accurately reflect the change purpose.

Output Expectations:
- ".gitignore" is updated and committed in a single, dedicated commit if required.
- All other necessary changes are committed as multiple atomic commits, organized by change purpose.
- No commit contains mixed or unrelated changes.
- No prohibited Git operations are performed.
